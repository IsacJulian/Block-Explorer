# Block Explorer

This project is a frontend application that interacts with an Ethereum blockchain. The application is built with JavaScript and uses Viem to communicate with the blockchain. It has been tested against a local Ethereum node running with Ganache.

# Features
- Retrieve account balance: Users can enter an Ethereum address and get the current balance.
- Execute transactions: Users can send Ether to another address, and the transaction is recorded on the blockchain.
- View transaction details: A dedicated page displays detailed information about a specific transaction.
- View all blocks and transactions: An overview page shows all blocks in the blockchain along with their associated transactions.
